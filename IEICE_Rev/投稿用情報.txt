summary:
A regular pattern is a string consisting of constant and distinct variable symbols. 
The language L(p) of a pattern p is defined as the set of all constant strings obtained by replacing each variable with a constant string. 
Let RP^k denote the class of all sets containing at most k (k >= 2) regular patterns. 
Sato et al. (Proc. ALT'98, 1998) showed that the finite set S_2(P), obtained from P in RP^k by replacing variables with constant strings of length at most two, serves as a characteristic set for the language L(P), which is 
the union of the languages L(p) for all regular patterns p contained in P. 
They also claimed that RP^k is compact with respect to language containment when the number of constant symbols is at least 2k - 1.
In this paper, we revisit their results and identify an error in the original proof of their theorem. 
We then present a new and correct proof by introducing additional conditions that guarantee the validity of their claim. 
Furthermore, we study the subclass RP^k_{NAV}, consisting of at most k (k >= 1) non-adjacent regular patterns, in which no two variable symbols occur consecutively. 
For any P in RP^k_{NAV}, we prove that the set S_2(P) serves as a characteristic set of L(P) and that RP^k_{NAV}$ is compact with respect to language containment if the number of constant symbols is at least k + 2.
These results demonstrate that finite unions of non-adjacent regular pattern languages can be learned efficiently under weaker constraints on constant symbols than those required in the general case. 
Our analysis thus refines and extends the compactness properties of regular pattern languages originally discussed by Sato et al., providing a corrected theoretical foundation for subsequent studies on the learnability of pattern languages.
