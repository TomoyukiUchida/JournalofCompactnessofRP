summary:
A regular pattern is a string consisting of constant symbols and distinct variable symbols.
The language L(p) of a regular pattern p is the set of all constant strings obtained by replacing all variable symbols in the regular pattern p with constant strings.
Let k be an integer greater than or eqaul to 2. RPatkei denotes the class of all sets consisting at most k regular patterns.
Sato et al. (Proc. ALT'98, 1998) showed that the finite set S_2(P) of symbol strings is a characteristic set of L(P)
the union of the languages L(p) for all regular patterns p contained in P,
where S_2(P) is obtained from P in RPatkei by substituting variables with symbol strings of at most length 2. 
They also showed that RPatkei has compactness with respect to containment, if the number of constant symbols is greater than or equal to 2k-1.
In this paper, we check the their results and correct the error of the proof of their theorem.
Further, we consider the set NAVRP of all non-adjacent regular patterns, which are regular patterns without adjacent variables, and show that the set S_2(P) obtained from a set P in the class NAVRPkei of at most k non-adjacent regular patterns is a characteristic set of L(P), where k is greater than or equal to 1.
Further we show that NAVRPkei has compactness with respect to containment if the number of constant symbols is greater than or equal to k+2.
Thus we show that we can design an efficient learning algorithm of a finite union of pattern languages of non-adjacent regular patterns with the number of constant symbols which is smaller than the case of regular patterns.
